## Beauty of Python

```markdown
###In Java -

class HelloWorld 
{ 
    // Your program begins with a call to main(). 
    // Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window. 
    public static void main(String args[]) 
    { 
        System.out.println("Hello, World"); 
    } 
} 

###In C++

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() 
{
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
